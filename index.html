                <span class="profile-bio">Bio: </span> Lisa was the second
                member introduced to the public. She was the only person
                accepted to YG during the 2010 YG Audition in Thailand. In 2012,
                she was introduced through a teaser video called, “Who’s That
                Girl?” Being the first non-Korean idol in YG, Lisa’s presence
                has gotten many people curious about her talents. She has been
                acknowledged for her “elegant body ratio” and her “exotic
                visual.” Lisa is especially talented in dancing, even YG himself
                praises her. She knows four languages: Thai, Korean, English,
                and Japanese. She is also childhood friends with GOT7’s BamBam
                as they were both part of the dance crew “We Zaa Cool.” In July
                2017, she briefly had her own show via OnStyle’s Attraction TV
                called “LISA TV.”

                in 2012. Between 2012 and 2013, she was heavily featured in
                various music videos and in features on her senior labelmates’
                albums. Jennie lived in New Zealand for five years and is
                capable of speaking three languages: Korean, Japanese, and

                <span class="profile-bio">Bio: </span> Unlike the other members,
                Rosé was the “new face” who hadn’t yet been officially
                introduced to the public until the weeks leading up to debut.
                She was born in New Zealand and when she was eight years old,
                she and her family moved to Australia. Before joining YG, she
                attended Canterbury Girls Secondary College and was active in
                her church’s youth group. After being encouraged by her father,
                Rosé auditioned for YG in 2012. She beat out 400 people for the
                audition. She soon then moved to Korea after being chosen to be
                a trainee under the company. Later on that same year, she was
                featured on G-Dragon’s album One of A Kind on the track,
                “Without You.” However, she was never officially credited for
                her feature until her debut teasers. Rosé can speak English and
                Korean fluently and she is also skilled at playing the piano and
                guitar.
